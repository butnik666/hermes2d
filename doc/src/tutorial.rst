Tutorial Part I (Linear Problems)
=================================

This tutorial should give you a good idea of how Hermes2D works. After reading it, you will
be able to create your own applications and/or adjust existing Hermes2D examples for your 
purposes. At the beginning of every section we give a reference to the corresponding example in the 
Hermes2D git repository -- there you will always find the corresponding main.cpp file, mesh file(s) etc.
The document is under continuous development - if you find bugs or would like us to 
improve something, let us know through the `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/hermes2d/>`_.

Finite Element Mesh
-------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `01-mesh <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/01-mesh>`_. 

Every finite element computation starts with partitioning the domain
into a finite element mesh. Hermes uses triangles and quadrilaterals, and 
can combine both element types in one mesh. While complicated meshes need 
to be constructed using specialized mesh generation software, in many cases 
we only need a simple initial mesh that can be created by hand. In Hermes, all you 
need to do is partition the domain very coarsely into several large elements,
and the adaptivity will take care of the rest. 

.. image:: img/simplemesh.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 400
   :alt: Sample finite element mesh.

The domain is defined via four macroelements -- two
quadrilaterals and two curvilinear triangles. The elements are enumerated from 0 to 3. 
One also needs to enumerate all mesh vertices and assign markers to all boundary edges. 
Boundary markers are used to link boundary conditions with the boundary edges. 

Mesh File Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hermes can read meshes in its own generic format as well as in the
`ExodusII <http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/>`_ format
(this is, for example, the output of `Cubit <http://cubit.sandia.gov/>`_).
First let us discuss the generic Hermes mesh data format. Reading
of ExodusII mesh files is very simple as we will see in example "iron-water". 

Generic Hermes mesh file consists of variable assignments. Each variable can hold a real number, 
list of real numbers, or list of lists. The following are all valid definitions in 
the Hermes mesh file format::

    # comments start with a hash
    var = 5.0 + cos(pi)  # number
    list = { 1, 2, 3, 4, var }  # list
    pairs = { {1, 2}, {1, var}, {0, list} }  # list of lists

Every mesh file must contain at least the variables ``vertices``, ``elements``
and ``boundaries``. The variable ``vertices`` defines the coordinates
of all mesh vertices (in any order). In our case it looks like this::

    a = 1.0  # size of the mesh
    b = sqrt(2)/2

    vertices =
    {
      { 0, -a },    # vertex 0
      { a, -a },    # vertex 1
      { -a, 0 },    # vertex 2
      { 0, 0 },     # vertex 3
      { a, 0 },     # vertex 4
      { -a, a },    # vertex 5
      { 0, a },     # vertex 6
      { a*b, a*b }  # vertex 7
    }

The variable ``elements`` defines all elements in the mesh via zero-based indices of their vertices in counter-clockwise order, plus an extra number denoting the element (material) marker. Element markers allow you to use different material parameters in areas with different material parameters. Moreover, Hermes allows you to assign different weak formulations to those areas, which can be very useful for some types of multiphysics problems. If the domain is composed of only one material, as in our case, all elements may be assigned a zero marker:
::

    elements =
    {
      { 0, 1, 4, 3, 0 },  # quad 0
      { 3, 4, 7, 0 },     # tri 1
      { 3, 7, 6, 0 },     # tri 2
      { 2, 3, 6, 5, 0 }   # quad 3
    }

The last mandatory variable, ``boundaries``, defines boundary markers for all
boundary edges. By default, all edges have zero markers. Only those with
positive markers are considered to be part of the domain boundary and can be
assigned a boundary condition, as we will see later. An edge is identified by
two vertex indices. In our case, we have
::

    boundaries =
    {
      { 0, 1, 1 },
      { 1, 4, 2 },
      { 3, 0, 4 },
      { 4, 7, 2 },
      { 7, 6, 2 },
      { 2, 3, 4 },
      { 6, 5, 2 },
      { 5, 2, 3 }
    }

Finally, the file can also include the variable ``curves``, which lists all
curved edges.  Each curved edge is described by one NURBS curve, defined by its
degree, control points and knot vector. Simplified syntax is available for
circular arcs.

NURBS Curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every NURBS curve is defined by its degree, control points with weights and the
knot vector. The degree $d$ is a positive integer, usually 1, 2, 3 or 5. Lines
and polylines are of degree 1, circles have degree 2 and free-form curves are
of degree 3 or 5. The control points $p_i$, $i = 0 \ldots n$, are the main tool for changing the
shape of the curve. A curve of degree $d$ must have at least $d+1$ control
points. In Hermes, the endpoints of the edge are always assumed to be the
first and last control points and therefore only the inner control points are
listed in the mesh file. There is a weight $w_i \geq 0$ for every control point,
that influences the shape of the curve in its vicinity. If $w_i = 0$ then 
$p_i$ has no effect on the shape.  As $w_i$ increases, the curve is pulled 
towards $p_i$.

The knot vector is a sequence of $m+1$ values that determines how much and
where the control points influence the shape. The relation $m = n+d+1$ must
hold. The sequence is nondecreasing, $t_i \leq t_{i+1}$, and divides the whole
interval $[0,1]$ into smaller intervals which determine the area of influence
of the control points. Since the curve has to start and end at the edge
vertices, the knot vector in Hermes always starts with $d+1$ zeros and ends
with $d+1$ ones. Only the inner knots are listed in the above definition of the
variable ``curves``, where $knots$ is a simple list of real values. For the 
above example, we have
::

    curves =
    {
      { 4, 7, 45 },  # +45 degree circular arcs
      { 7, 6, 45 }
    }
    # EOF


Loading Mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a ''Hello world'' example, let us load the mesh we have just created, and display it in a window. 
Every main.cpp file in the git repository contains lots of comments and instructions. Skipping those, 
the `main.cpp <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/01-mesh/main.cpp>`_ 
file begins with creating an instance of the class Mesh. In order to load
the mesh file, you have to create a mesh loader class (in our case that is ``H2DReader``) and
call the method ``load()``:
::

    #include "hermes2d.h"

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      // load the mesh file
      Mesh mesh;
      H2DReader mloader;
      mloader.load("domain.mesh", &mesh);

Note: To load the exodus-II mesh file, one has to use ``ExodusIIReader`` class instead.

The following portion of code illustrates various types of initial mesh refinements.
It does not matter if the mesh becomes irregular, in fact, arbitrarily irregular
meshes are at the heart of Hermes: 
::

      // perform some sample initial refinements
      mesh.refine_all_elements();          // refines all elements
      mesh.refine_towards_vertex(3, 4);    // refines mesh towards
                                           // vertex #3 (4x)
      mesh.refine_towards_boundary(2, 4);  // refines all elements
                                           // along boundary 2 (4x)
      mesh.refine_element(86, 0);          // refines element #86
                                           // isotropically
      mesh.refine_element(112, 0);         // refines element #112
                                           // isotropically
      mesh.refine_element(84, 2);          // refines element #84
                                           // anisotropically
      mesh.refine_element(114, 1);         // refines element #114
                                           // anisotropically

Other ways of modifying meshes on the fly include
::

    Mesh::refine_element(int id, int refinement = 0)
    Mesh::refine_by_criterion(int (*criterion)(Element* e), int depth)
    Mesh::refine_towards_vertex(int vertex_id, int depth)
    Mesh::regularize(int n)
    Mesh::unrefine_element(int id)
    Mesh::unrefine_all_elements()

See the file `src/mesh.cpp <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/mesh.cpp>`_ for more details. 
The following code illustrates how to visualize the mesh using the class MeshView:
::

    // display the mesh
    // (100, 100) is the upper left corner position
    // 500 x 500 is the window size
    MeshView mview("Hello world!", 100, 100, 500, 500);
    mview.show(&mesh);

You can initialize it by supplying the title of the window and its initial position and size (all of these
parameters are optional). The class MeshView provides the method show() that displays a window showing the mesh:

.. image:: img/meshview2.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 400
   :alt: Image of the mesh created via the MeshView class.

Every main.cpp file is finished with 
::

    // wait for keyboard or mouse input
    View::wait();
    return 0;
  }

so that you have a chance to see the graphical output.



Setting Up Finite Element Space
-------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `02-space <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/02-space>`_. 

Hermes follows the mathematical concept of FEM closely -- after creating a mesh,
in the next step one needs to construct a finite element space on it.
The following predefined spaces are currently available:

* H1Space - the most common space of continuous, piecewise-polynomial functions belonging to $H^1(\Omega) = \{ v \in L^2(\Omega); \nabla u \in [L^2(\Omega)]^2 \}$,
* HcurlSpace - the space of vector-valued functions discontinuous along mesh edges, with continuous tangential component on the edges $H(\mbox{curl},\Omega) = \{ E \in [L^2(\Omega)]^2; \nabla \times E \in L^2(\Omega)\}$,
* HdivSpace - the space of vector-valued functions discontinuous along mesh edges, with continuous normal component on the edges $H(\mbox{div},\Omega) = \{ v \in [L^2(\Omega)^2; \nabla \cdot v \in L^2(\Omega)\}$,
* L2Space -  the space of functions discontinuous along mesh edges, belonging to the space $L^2(\Omega)$.

All these spaces allow for higher-order elements and meshes with arbitrary-level hanging nodes.
If you are not familiar with higher-order FEM, let us just say that the spaces can contain
quadratic, cubic, etc., *edge functions* that generate higher-degree
polynomials along mesh edges, and *bubble functions* that complete the higher-order
approximation in element interiors. Edge functions are associated with mesh edges,
and bubble functions with element interiors. The next figure shows a patch consisting of two triangular elements. An edge function is shown on the left, and a bubble function on one of the triangles on the right:

.. image:: img/basisfn.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 200
   :alt: Fourth-order edge function  (left) and one of the fifth-order bubble functions (right).

There are many possible ways of defining the
higher-order basis functions. A particular set of polynomials is called
*shapeset*. Using good shapeset is crucial for the
performance of the *hp*-FEM. No shapeset can be optimal for all possible operators.
Therefore, Hermes offers several shapesets from which
you need to choose one when creating a FE space. The ones which perform best
in most computations (according to our experience) are simply called
H1Shapeset, HcurlShapeset, HdivShapeset and L2Shapeset.
Others can be found in the files `src/shapeset* <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/src>`_ in the git repo.
Any shapeset can be used for more than one space.

We are now ready for an example. The following code snippets come from
the `main.cpp <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/02-space/main.cpp>`_ file. 
We assume that a mesh has already been loaded. First we create an instance of H1Shapeset and then an
instance of H1Space, supplying the mesh and shapeset pointers:
::

    // create a shapeset and an H1 space
    H1Shapeset shapeset;
    H1Space space(&mesh, &shapeset);

When the space is created, we need to initialize the polynomial
degrees of all elements. (The words *degree* and *order* have the same meaning for us.)
This can be done for individual elements by calling the method
Space::set_element_order(), or for all elements at once using
Space::set_uniform_order(). It is important to note that element degrees
are stored in Space, not in Mesh. The reason is that you can
have multiple different spaces with different element degrees and even types 
over the same mesh. In Hermes, Mesh only stores geometrical information.
::

    // assign element orders and initialize the space
    space.set_uniform_order(P_INIT);
    // enumerate basis functions
    space.assign_dofs();

A space created in this way is ready for use. By default, it is equipped with
zero Neumann boundary conditions on the entire domain boundary. Later we will see
how to change that.

As a debugging/learning feature, Hermes enables visualization of all basis functions 
in a Space. Similarly to MeshView, you can create a BaseView object and use it 
to display the entire basis (VectorBaseView has to be used for vector-valued 
approximations in spaces Hcurl and Hdiv - this will be discussed later). 
You can cycle through all basis functions in the window using the arrow keys. 
If you press the left mouse button at the beginning, you will see the Dirichlet 
lift (a function that represents Dirichlet boundary conditions).
::

    // view the basis functions
    BaseView bview;
    bview.show(&space);

This is how the last figure above was obtained (press the '3' key for 3D mode).
We suggest that you spend some time experimenting with element refinements and 
hanging nodes to see how basis functions on irregular meshes look like.

Solving Poisson Equation
------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `03-poisson <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/03-poisson>`_. 

Let us solve the Poisson equation

.. math::
    :label: poisson1

       -\Delta u = CONST_F

on the L-shaped domain $\Omega$ from the previous example,
equipped with a homogeneous (zero) Dirichlet boundary condition

.. math::
    :label: poisson2

       u = 0\ \ \  \mbox{on}\  \partial \Omega,

where $CONST_F$ is a real number. The weak formulation 
is derived in the standard way, first by multiplying equation :eq:`poisson1` with a test
function $v$, then integrating over the domain $\Omega$, and then applying the Green's
theorem (integration by parts) to the second derivatives.
Because of the homogeneous Dirichlet condition :eq:`poisson2`,
the proper space for the solution is $V = H^1_0(\Omega)$. The weak formulation reads:
Find $u \in V$ such that

.. math::
    :label: poissonweak

         \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \;\mbox{d\bfx} = CONST_F \int_\Omega v \;\mbox{d\bfx} \ \ \ \mbox{for all}\ v \in V.

Equation :eq:`poissonweak` has the standard form $a(u,v) = l(v)$ and thus in Hermes
we need a way to specify the bilinear form $a(u,v)$ and the linear form $l(v)$.
In the code this is done by implementing the following two functions:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

These functions will be called for each element during the stiffness matrix
assembly and must return the values of the bilinear and linear forms for the given arguments.
RealFunction represents one of the basis functions restricted to the
current element and RefMap represents the reference mapping of the current element.
There are methods for extracting the values of the basis functions at integration points,
which allows you to evaluate the integrals by yourself, but this is normally not needed,
since many common weak forms have already been implemented.
In this case, we can simply use the predefined functions
int_grad_u_grad_v and int_v:
::

    // return the value \int \nabla u . \nabla v dx
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_grad_u_grad_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }
   
    // return the value \int v dx
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return CONST_F * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

We can now state our problem in the following way:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form));
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(linear_form));

The class WeakForm represents the weak formulation of the PDE and must be
initialized with the number of equations in the system, in our case one. We then
supply the class pointers to our bilinear and linear form functions. If the PDE
was more complicated, we could add multiple bilinear and/or linear forms.

Given the weak formulation and the discretization determined by the space and its mesh,
we can proceed to the approximate solution of the problem by the Galerkin method.
This method is the core of Hermes and provides a way to obtain a sparse linear
system of equations, represented by the class LinSystem in the code. The solution
of the linear system then yields an approximate solution of the original problem.

The class LinSystem needs three things: your weak formulation, your spaces and
finally an external sparse matrix solver, for example CG or UMFPACK. The following lines
create the linear solver, initialize the LinSystem class and pass a pointer to
the H1Space we have created in the previous section.
::

    // initialize the linear system and solver
    UmfpackSolver umfpack;
    LinSystem sys(&wf, &umfpack);
    sys.set_spaces(1, &space);
    sys.set_pss(1, &pss);

The last line must be included for historical reasons. During matrix assembly,
Hermes caches the values of all shape function polynomials for better performance.
The cache is represented by the class PrecalcShapeset and you have to
include the following line at the beginning of your program:
::

    PrecalcShapeset pss(&shapeset);

Finally, we tell LinSystem to assemble the stiffness matrix and the right-hand
side and solve the resulting linear system: 
::

    // assemble the stiffness matrix and solve the system
    Solution sln;
    sys.assemble();
    sys.solve(1, &sln);

For the Poisson problem, we are finished. The last two lines can be repeated many 
times in time-dependent problems. The instance of the class Solution, upon the
completion of LinSystem::solve(), contains the approximate solution of
the PDE. You can ask for its values or you can visualize the solution immediately 
using the ScalarView class:
::

    // visualize the solution
    ScalarView view("Solution");
    view.show(&sln);

The following figure shows the output.

.. image:: img/poisson.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 350
   :alt: Solution of the Poisson equation.

Numerical Integration
---------------------

You may wonder why templates are used in the definition of weak forms. As a matter of fact, 
they do not have to be, as we will see later. However, if the weak form only contains 
algebraic operations (without if-then statements and such), templates help to determine
numerical integration orders automatically. In higher-order FEM, basis and test functions may 
have very different polynomial degrees, ranging from one and some maximum polynomial 
degree (currently 10 in Hermes). The basis and test functions can be combined inside the 
weak forms in many different ways. As a result, the minimum quadrature order which is needed 
to evaluate a weak form accurately may vary a lot - between zero (product of gradients of 
two linear functions) to infinity (whenever a nonpolynomial expression is present). 
Numerical quadrature is one of the trickiest issues in higher-order FEM.

Of course, a brute-force solution to this problem would be to integrate everything using 
a maximum order, but this would lead to tremendous computing times. Therefore Hermes offers 
two options: the polynomial degree of the integrated expressions can be detected 
automatically (the templates). Or, the user can define for each weak form the resulting 
polynomial degree explicitly. If the weak form only contains polynomial expressions, the former
approach works very well. If the form is more complicated, it is recommended to handle the
integration orders explicitly. This will be described in detail in example 07-general later.
Till then, we will use the automated way.

Boundary Conditions
-------------------

Hermes recognizes two basic types of boundary conditions: *essential* and *natural*.
Essential boundary conditions influence the finite element space while natural
conditions do not (they are incorporated into boundary integrals in the weak formulation).
In the context of elliptic problems, Dirichlet conditions are essential and Neumann/Newton
conditions are natural.

Dirichlet BC
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `04-bc-dirichlet <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/04-bc-dirichlet>`_. 

Since essential conditions restrict degrees of freedom (DOF) in the FE space, 
they need to be incorporated while the space is set up.
The user has to provide the following two callback functions:
::

    int bc_types(int marker);
    scalar bc_values(int marker, double x, double y);

The first one, given the boundary marker number, determines the type of BC which the associated
portion of the domain boundary belongs to, by returning one of the predefined constants 
BC_ESSENTIAL or BC_NATURAL. The second callback needs to return the boundary value for a given marker
and position on the boundary (only needed for essential boundary condition markers - for natural
boundary conditions this value is ignored).
The space initialization can then look as follows:
::

    H1Space space(&mesh, &shapeset);
    space.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    space.set_bc_values(bc_values);

Suppose we would like to modify the previous Poisson model problem in the following way:

.. math::
         -\Delta u = CONST_F,\ u(x,y) = -\frac{CONST_F}{4}(x^2 + y^2)\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \partial \Omega.


Besides changing the linear form, we need to specify that all the boundary markers 1, 2, 3, 4
denote the essential boundary condition:
::

    int bc_types(int marker)
    {
      return BC_ESSENTIAL;
    }

Further, the value callback must return the value of the Dirichlet BC:
::

    scalar bc_values(int marker, double x, double y)
    {
      return (-CONST_F/4)*(x*x + y*y);
    }

It is easy to see that the solution to this problem is the function

.. math::
         u(x,y) = -\frac{CONST_F}{4}(x^2 + y^2). 

For the value $CONST_F = -4$, the output is shown below:

.. image:: img/dirichlet.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 350
   :alt: Solution of the Dirichlet problem.

Neumann BC
~~~~~~~~~~

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `05-bc-neumann <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/05-bc-neumann>`_. 

Next, let us consider Neumann boundary conditions. The new model problem
will have the form

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}   -\Delta u = CONST_F,\ \ \ \ \ &&u = 0\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_4,\\                            &&\dd{u}{n} = C_1\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_1,\\                            &&\dd{u}{n} = C_2\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_2,\\                            &&\dd{u}{n} = C_3\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_3. \end{eqnarray*}

where $\Gamma_1 \dots \Gamma_4$ correspond to the edges marked $1 \dots 4$. Now, the weak formulation contains some surface integrals:

.. math::

    \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \;\mbox{d\bfx} =   CONST_F\int_\Omega v \;\mbox{d\bfx}   + C_1\int_{\Gamma_1} \!v \;\mbox{d}l   + C_2\int_{\Gamma_2} \!v \;\mbox{d}l   + C_3\int_{\Gamma_3} \!v \;\mbox{d}l


In Hermes, all forms in the standard weak formulation $a(u,v) = l(v)$
are in fact defined as a sum of contributions from volume integrals and from
surface integrals. In the case of the linear form $l(v)$, this means

.. math::

    l(v) = \sum_m l_m^{\,\rm vol}(v) + \sum_n l_n^{\,\rm surf}(v).

We have already seen volumetric linear forms in example 03-poisson. 
Surface linear forms are implemented similarly. Our new right-hand side will
be represented by two functions with the following prototypes:

::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

and will be added to the WeakForm by the following code:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form));
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(linear_form));
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(linear_form_surf));

The surface linear form is defined as follows:

::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return CONST_GAMMA[e->marker - 1] * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

Here, we have used the predefined surface integral surf_int_v (see the
file `src/integrals_h1.h <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/integrals_h1.h>`_). 
If the boundary conditions were more complicated, we could also
have used surf_int_F_v, where F stands for an arbitrary user-supplied
function returning the value $\partial u/\partial n$.

Note that the mesh is refined towards the re-entrant corner in order to 
capture the singular gradient.
::

    // load the mesh file
    Mesh mesh;
    H2DReader mloader;
    mloader.load("domain.mesh", &mesh);
    mesh.refine_towards_vertex(3, CORNER_REF_LEVEL);

The gradient magnitude can be visualized via a MagFilter:
::

    // compute and show gradient magnitude
    // (note that the infinite gradient at the re-entrant
    // corner will be truncated for visualization purposes)
    ScalarView gradview("Gradient", 650, 0, 600, 600);
    MagFilter grad(&sln, &sln, FN_DX, FN_DY);
    gradview.show(&grad);

The approximate solution for the values $C_1 = -1/2$, $C_2 = 1$, $C_3 = -1/2$,
along with the singularity of gradient at the re-entrant corner are
shown in the following figures:

Newton BC
~~~~~~~~~

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `06-bc-newton <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/06-bc-newton>`_. 

Another common natural boundary condition is the Newton (sometimes called Robin) condition
of the form

.. math::

    \dd{u}{n} + c_1 u = c_2, \ \ \ \ c_1 \ne 0.

Analogously to Neumann conditions, also Newton conditions yield surface integrals. However,
this time they are both in the bilinear form and in the linear form,
The bilinear form is
a sum of volume and surface forms that can be added to the weak formulation using the methods
add_biform() and add_biform_surf(). 
The surface bilinear form must have the following prototype:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

Inside this function you can use predefined
forms such as surf_int_u_v, surf_int_F_u_v (see the
file `src/integrals_h1.h <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/integrals_h1.h>`_) or your custom forms.

The following code snippet contains the linear and bilinear forms:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_grad_u_grad_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return H * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return T0 * H * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

  

Here, $T_0$ is the exterior temperature, and $H$ is the heat flux.
The above forms are registered using
::

    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form));
    wf.add_biform_surf(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form_surf), 1);
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(linear_form_surf), 1);

The last parameter in add_biform_surf() and add_liform_surf() is the boundary marker of the 
Newton boundary. The following figures show the solution and singularity of gradient 
at the re-entrant corner:

General 2nd-Order Linear Equation
---------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `07-general <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/07-general>`_. 


This example deals with a linear second-order equation of the form 

.. math::

         -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(a_{11}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(a_{12}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(a_{21}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(a_{22}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) + a_1(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + a_{21}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + a_0(x,y)u = rhs(x,y),

equipped with Dirichlet and/or Neumann boundary conditions. It has two goals: (a) to show the way one defines and uses space-dependent coefficients, and (b) to show how integration orders in weak forms can be handled explicitly. 

First we define the (generally) non-constant equation coefficients:
::

    double a_11(double x, double y) {
      if (y > 0) return 1 + x*x + y*y;
      else return 1;
    }

and so on. Then we define boundary conditions as usual. The weak formulation contains
both volumetric and surface integrals. 

The Ord class in Hermes (see the file `src/forms.h 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/forms.h>`_) provides
an automatic parser of weak forms that is able to determine the integration orders for 
algebraic expressions. So, in order to define an integration order explicitly, one can 
provide on top the weak form another function that defines a simple algebraic expression 
that leads the parser to the desired polynomial degree. The values defined in this  
additional function are not used for computation. 

::

    // (Volumetric) bilinear form
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {
        double x = e->x[i];
        double y = e->y[i];
        result += (a_11(x, y)*u->dx[i]*v->dx[i] + 
                   a_12(x, y)*u->dy[i]*v->dx[i] +
                   a_21(x, y)*u->dx[i]*v->dy[i] +
                   a_22(x, y)*u->dy[i]*v->dy[i] +
                   a_1(x, y)*u->dx[i]*v->val[i] +
                   a_2(x, y)*u->dy[i]*v->val[i] +
                   a_0(x, y)*u->val[i]*v->val[i]) * wt[i];
      }
      return result;
    }

    // Integration order for the bilinear form
    Ord bilinear_form_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *u, 
                      Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return u->val[0] * v->val[0] * x * x; // returning the sum of the degrees of the basis 
                                            // and test function plus two
    }

    // Surface linear form (natural boundary conditions)
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_F_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, g_N, v, e);
    }
  
    // Integration order for surface linear form
    Ord linear_form_surf_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return v->val[0] * x * x;  // returning the polynomial degree of the test function plus two
    }
  
    // Volumetric linear form (right-hand side)
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_F_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, rhs, v, e);
    }
  
    // Integration order for the volumetric linear form
    Ord linear_form_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return v->val[0] * x * x;  // returning the polynomial degree of the test function plus two
    }

The polynomial degree of basis and test functions also can be accessed directly as follows:

::

    Ord bilinear_form_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *u, 
                          Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      int uo = u->val[0].get_order();
      int vo = v->val[0].get_order();
      return Ord(uo + vo);
    }

Note that in principle it is also possible to return a constant order (for example 5) by using 

::

    Ord bilinear_form_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *u, 
                      Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return Ord(5);
    }

Currently, one cannot make the integration order dependent on spatial coordinates and such. However,
one can assign different weak forms to elements with different material flags. This is
described in examples `iron-water <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/examples/iron-water>`_,
`saphir <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/examples/saphir/main.cpp>`_ and others.

Also note the sign of the surface linear form - all linear forms have to be on the right-hand side,
all bilinear forms on the left. 

The output of this example is shown below:

Systems of Equations
--------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `08-system <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/08-system>`_. 

So far we always have solved a single linear PDE with the weak formulation
of the form $a(u,v) = l(v)$, where $u, v$ were continuous approximations in the
$H^1$ space. Analogously one can handle single equations whose solutions lie in the spaces
$Hcurl$, $Hdiv$ or $L^2$.

However, Hermes also can handle a system of $n$ linear PDEs, provided that the weak formulation 
can be written as

.. math::
    :label: weaksystem

      a_{11}(u_1,v_1)\,+ a_{12}(u_2,v_1)\,+ \cdots\,+ a_{1n}(u_n,v_1) = l_1(v_1),

      a_{21}(u_1,v_2)\,+ a_{22}(u_2,v_2)\,+ \cdots\,+ a_{2n}(u_n,v_2) = l_2(v_2),

                                                          \vdots

      a_{n1}(u_1,v_n) + a_{n2}(u_2,v_n) + \cdots + a_{nn}(u_n,v_n) = l_n(v_n).

The solution $u = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$ and test functions $v =
(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ belong to the space $W = V_1 \times V_2 \times \dots
\times V_n$, where each $V_i$ is one of the available function spaces.

Let us illustrate this by solving a simple problem of linear elasticity. Consider a
two-dimensional elastic body shown in the following figure (the bottom edge is
axis of planar symmetry):

.. image:: img/elastsample.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500
   :height: 300
   :alt: Geometry and boundary conditions.

In the plane-strain model of linear elasticity the goal is to determine the
deformation of the body subject to the forces $f$. The deformation is sought
as a vector function $u(x) = (u_1, u_2)^T$, describing the displacement of each point
$x \in \Omega$ after the load $f = (f_1, f_2)^T$ is applied.


The boundary conditions are

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n} &=& f_1 \ \text{on $\Gamma_3$,} \\
    \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n} &=& 0 \ \text{on $\Gamma_2$, $\Gamma_4$, $\Gamma_5$,} \\
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial n} &=& f_2 \ \text{on $\Gamma_3$,} \\
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial n} &=& 0 \ \text{on $\Gamma_2$, $\Gamma_4$, $\Gamma_5$,} \\
    u_1 &=& u_2 = 0 \ \mbox{on} \ \Gamma_1. 
    \end{eqnarray*}

Applying the standard procedure to the elastostatic equilibrium equations, we arrive at the following weak formulation:

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}   \int_\Omega     (2\mu\!+\!\lambda)\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_1} + \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_2} +     \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_2} + \lambda\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_1}     \,\mbox{d}\bfx \!\!&=&\!\!\!     \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_1 v_1 \,\mbox{d}S, \\ \smallskip   \int_\Omega     \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_1} + \lambda\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_2} +     (2\mu\!+\!\lambda)\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_2} + \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_1}     \,\mbox{d}\bfx \!\!&=&\!\!\!     \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_2 v_2 \,\mbox{d}S. \end{eqnarray*}


We see that the weak formulation can indeed be written in the form :eq:`weaksystem`:

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
      a_{11}(u_1, v_1) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega (2\mu+\lambda)\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_1} + \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_2} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,  \\
      a_{12}(u_2, v_1) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_2} + \lambda\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_1} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,\\
      a_{21}(u_1, v_2) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_1} + \lambda\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_2} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,\\
      a_{22}(u_2, v_2) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega (2\mu+\lambda)\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_2} + \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_1} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,  \\
      l_{1}(v_1) \!&=&\!
      \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_1 v_1 \,\mbox{d}S, \\
      l_{2}(v_2) \!&=&\!
      \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_2 v_2 \,\mbox{d}S.
    \end{eqnarray*}

Here, $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are material constants (Lame coefficients) defined as

.. math::

    \mu = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}, \ \ \ \ \  \lambda = \frac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)},

where $E$ is the Young modulus and $\nu$ the Poisson ratio of the material. For
steel, we have $E = 200$ GPa and $\nu = 0.3$. The load is $f = (0, 10^4)^T$ N.

We begin with defining the function spaces for the two solution
components, $u_1$ and $u_2$ (the $x$ and $y$ displacement). The boundary
conditions can be implemented as
::

    int bc_types(int marker)
      { return (marker == 1) ? BC_ESSENTIAL : BC_NATURAL;; }

    double bc_values(int marker, double x, double y)
      { return 0;}

Next we create the two displacement spaces, xdisp and ydisp:
::

    // create the x displacement space
    H1Space xdisp(&mesh, &shapeset);
    xdisp.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    xdisp.set_bc_values(bc_values);
    xdisp.set_uniform_order(P\_INIT);

    // create the y displacement space
    H1Space ydisp(&mesh, &shapeset);
    ydisp.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    ydisp.set_bc_values(bc_values);
    ydisp.set_uniform_order(P\_INIT);

Our WeakForm instance will be initialized for two equations in the system.
After implementing the weak forms using the predefined integrals
int_a_dudx_dvdx_b_dudy_dvdy and int_a_dudx_dvdy_b_dudy_dvdx,
we can add them to the weak formulation using add_biform().
The first two parameters of this method correspond to the position of the form
in the block weak form :eq:`weaksystem` with zero-based numbering. The 
surface linear form is treated analogously.
::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(2);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form_0_0), SYM);  // Note that only one symmetric part is
    wf.add_biform(0, 1, callback(bilinear_form_0_1), SYM);  // added in the case of symmetric bilinear
    wf.add_biform(1, 1, callback(bilinear_form_1_1), SYM);  // forms.
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(linear_form_surf_0), 3);
    wf.add_liform_surf(1, callback(linear_form_surf_1), 3);

An explanation of the extra parameter SYM in add_biform() is in order.
Since the two diagonal forms $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$ are symmetric, i.e.,
$a_{ii}(u,v) = a_{ii}(v,u)$, Hermes can be told to only evaluate them once for the
two cases $a_{ii}(u,v)$ and $a_{ii}(v,u)$ to speed up assembly. In fact, we should have
used the SYM flag already in the previous sections, since the form
$a(u,v) = \nabla u \cdot \nabla v$ is also symmetric. This is however not the case
for all forms and so the default value of the fourth parameter of add_biform() is UNSYM.

The off-diagonal forms $a_{12}(u_2, v_1)$ and $a_{21}(u_1, v_2)$ are not
(and cannot) be symmetric, since their arguments come from different spaces.
However, we can see that $a_{12}(u, v) = a_{21}(v, u)$, i.e., the corresponding blocks
of the local stiffness matrix are transposes of each other. Here, the SYM flag
has a different effect: it tells Hermes to take the block of the local stiffness
matrix corresponding to the form $a_{12}$, transpose it and copy it where a block
corresponding to $a_{21}$ would belong, without evaluating $a_{21}$ at all (this is why
we don't add bilinear_form_1_0). This again speeds up the matrix assembly.
You can also use the flag ANTISYM, which moreover inverts the sign of the block.
This makes sense in the case where $a_{ij}(u, v) = -a_{ji}(v, u)$.

It is recommended that you start with the default (and safe) UNSYM flag for all
forms when developing your project, and only optimize the evaluation of the forms when
the code works well.

With the WeakForm and spaces ready, we can initialize the linear system.
The only difference is that we now have two spaces determining the discretization
of the problem.
::

    LinSystem sys(&wf, &umfpack);
    sys.set_spaces(2, &xdisp, &ydisp);

All that is left is to assemble the stiffness matrix and solve the system.
Since we have two equations and two spaces, we receive two solutions, one for each
displacement component:
::

    Solution xsln, ysln;
    sys.assemble();
    sys.solve(2, &xsln, &ysln);

As in the previous sections, it is now possible to visualize the displacement
solutions, e.g.,
::

    ScalarView view("y displacement [m]");
    view.show(&ysln);

Usually, however, it is necessary to postprocess the solution in order to obtain more
informative visualization. In elasticity problems, one is often interested in material
stress, which is obtained by a formula combining the derivatives of the two displacements.
Hermes implements postprocessing through *filters*. A filter is a special class
which takes up to three Solutions, performs some computation and in the end acts
as another Solution, which can be visualized, or even fed into another filter.
Here, we can use the predefined filter VonMisesFilter, which calculates the
Von Mises stress:
::

    VonMisesFilter stress(&xsln, &ysln, mu, lambda);
    view.show(&stress, EPS_HIGH, 0);

The second parameter of show() is the visualization accuracy and can be
EPS_LOW, EPS_NORMAL (default) and EPS_HIGH. The third parameter is
the component number and is only valid for vector-valued ($Hcurl$) solutions.

Finally, in elasticity problems, it may be illustrative to distort the computational
domain according to the calculated displacement. The function View::show() can be
passed three more optional parameters, which represent the $x$ and $y$ displacement
and a multiplier to make the displacements visible.
::

    VonMisesFilter stress(&xsln, &ysln, mu, lambda);
    view.show(&stress, EPS_HIGH, 0, &xsln, &ysln, 1.5e5);

Time-Dependent Problems
-----------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `09-timedep <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/09-timedep>`_. 


This section describes the implementation of a simple time-dependent
heat transfer model that describes, in a naive approximation, how the St. Vitus cathedral
in Prague responds to changes in the surrounding air temperature
during one 24-hour cycle. The geometry is shown below:

.. image:: img/vitus1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 500
   :alt: Model geometry and temperature distribution after 24 hours.

We will solve the standard heat transfer equation

.. math::
    :label: eqvit1

       c \varrho\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \lambda \Delta T = 0

equipped with a Dirichlet condition

.. math::

     T = T_{init}

on the bottom edge $\Gamma_{ground}$ and a Newton condition

.. math::

     \frac{\partial T}{\partial \nu} = \alpha(T_{ext}(t) - T)

on the rest of the boundary $\Gamma_{air}$. Here, $c$ is the heat capacity of the material,
$\varrho$ the material density, $\lambda$ the thermal conductivity,
$T_{init}$ the fixed temperature on the
ground (same as the initial temperature of the building), and $\alpha$
the heat transfer coefficient 
between the building and the surrounding air. The surrounding air temperature
$T_{ext}$ is time-dependent of the form

.. math::

     T_{ext}(t) = T_{init} + 10\sin(2\pi t/T_{final}),

where $T_{final}$ is 24 hours (translated into seconds).

Equation :eq:`eqvit1` is also equipped with an initial condition of the
form

.. math::

     T(x,y,0) = T_{init}(x,y) \ \ \ \mbox{in} \ \Omega.



For simplicity we will use the implicit Euler method with a constant
time step $\tau$, which transforms equation :eq:`eqvit1` into


.. math::

     c \varrho\frac{T^{n+1} - T^n}{\tau} - \lambda \Delta T^{n+1} = 0.

The corresponding weak formulation is

.. math::

     \int_{\Omega} c \varrho\frac{T^{n+1}}{\tau} + \int_{\Omega} \lambda \nabla T^{n+1}\cdot \nabla v + \int_{\Gamma_{air}} \alpha \lambda T^{n+1}v = \int_{\Omega} c \varrho\frac{T^{n}}{\tau} + \int_{\Gamma_{air}} \alpha \lambda T_{ext}(t^{n+1})v.

The implementation starts by defining the
boundary condition types
::

    int bc_types(int marker)
    {
      if (marker == marker_ground) return BC_ESSENTIAL;
      else return BC_NATURAL;
    }

and values
::

    scalar bc_values(int marker, double x, double y)
    {
      if (marker == marker_ground) return T_INIT;
    }

Then the space for the temperature $T$ is set up:
::

    // set up spaces
    H1Space space(&mesh, &shapeset);
    space.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    space.set_bc_values(bc_values);
    space.set_uniform_order(P_INIT);

The bilinear and linear forms are defined as follows:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return HEATCAP * RHO * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v) / TAU +
             LAMBDA * int_grad_u_grad_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }
  
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return HEATCAP * RHO * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, ext->fn[0], v) / TAU;
    }
  
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return LAMBDA * ALPHA * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }
  
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return LAMBDA * ALPHA * temp_ext(TIME) * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

These forms are registered as follows:
::

    // weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, bilinear_form<double, double>, bilinear_form<Ord, Ord>);
    wf.add_biform_surf(0, 0, bilinear_form_surf<double, double>, bilinear_form_surf<Ord, Ord>, marker_air);
    wf.add_liform(0, linear_form<double, double>, linear_form<Ord, Ord>, ANY, 1, &tsln);
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, linear_form_surf<double, double>, linear_form_surf<Ord, Ord>, marker_air);

Before entering the main iteration loop, we need to initialize the previous solution
tsln with the initial condition $T_{init}$.
Besides holding the finite element solution, the Solution class
can be forced to return zero, to return a constant, or to return an arbitrary function
using the methods set_zero(), set_const() and set_exact(), respectively.
Here we simply call set_const() and supply the initial temperature:
::

    // set initial condition
    Solution tsln;
    tsln.set_const(&mesh, T_INIT);
 
We are now ready to start the iterative process. Since the stiffness matrix does
not depend on the solution, it only needs to be assembled once in the first time
step. For all remaining time steps it will be the same, and we just need to
re-construct the load vector. This is done via the Boolean variable rhsonly
which is set to false before the time stepping begins:
::

    // assemble and solve
    ls.assemble(rhsonly);
    rhsonly = true;
    ls.solve(1, &tsln);


=======================================
Tutorial Part II (Automatic Adaptivity)
=======================================

In the computations that we carried out so far, we have not paid any attention
to the accuracy of the results. In general, a computation on a fixed mesh is
not likely to be very accurate. There is a need for *adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR)* algorithms that improve the quality of the approximation by refining
mesh elements where the approximation is bad.

Adaptive h-FEM and hp-FEM
-------------------------

In traditional low-order FEM, refining an element is not algorithmically complicated,
and so the most difficult part is to find out what elements should be
refined. To do this, people employ various techniques ranging from rigorous
guaranteed a-posteriori error estimates to heuristic criteria such as residual
error indicators, error indicators based on steep gradients, etc. Unfortunately,
none of these approaches is suitable for Hermes: The rigorous guaranteed error
estimates only exist for very simple problems, such as linear elliptic PDEs,
and thus they are far from PDE-independent. Heuristic techniques are not
employed in Hermes for the same reason, and moreover since such criteria
lack a transparent relation to the true approximation error.

Adaptive low-order FEM is known to be notoriously ineffcient, and practitioners
are rightfully skeptical of it. The reason is illustrated here:

.. image:: img/lshape/conv_dof.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 400
   :alt: Typical convergence curves for adaptive linear FEM, quadratic FEM, and *hp*-FEM.

These convergence curves are typical representative examples, confirmed with
many numerical experiments of independent researchers, and supported with
theory. The horizontal axis shows (in linear scale) the number of degrees of freedom
(= size of the stiffness matrix) that increases during automatic adaptivity. The
vertical one shows the approximation error (in logarithmic scale). Note that in all
three cases, the error drops very fast during a short initial phase of the adaptive
computation. However, with both linear and quadratic FEM, the convergence slows
down dramatically as the adaptivity progresses. Note that the low-order FEM
is doomed to such slow convergence by its poor approximation properties -
an excellent adaptivity algorithm cannot improve it (and a bad
algorithm can make it even worse).

In order to obtain fast, usable adaptivity (the green curve), one
has to resort to adaptive *hp*-FEM. The *hp*-FEM takes advantage of two facts:

* Large high-degree elements approximate smooth parts of solution much better than small linear ones. We created the example 'smooth' to illustrate this fact. Check it out, the results are impressive.
* This holds the other way where the solution is not smooth.

Automatic adaptivity in the *hp*-FEM is substantially different from adaptivity
in low-order FEM, since every element can be refined in many different ways.
The following figure shows several refinement candidates for a fourth-order element.

.. image:: img/refinements.png
   :align: center
   :width: 650
   :height: 300
   :alt: Examples of *hp*-refinements.

Due to the large number of refinement options, classical error estimators (that
provide a constant error estimate per element) cannot be used to guide automatic 
*hp*-adaptivity. For this, one needs to know the *shape* of the
approximation error.

In analogy to the most successful adaptive ODE solvers,
Hermes uses a pair of approximations with different orders of accuracy to obtain
this information: *coarse mesh solution* and 
*fine mesh solution*. The initial coarse mesh is read from the mesh file,
and the initial fine mesh is created through its global refinement both in
$h$ and $p$.
The fine mesh solution is the approximation of interest both during the adaptive
process and at the end of computation. The coarse mesh
solution represents its low-order part.

Both these solutions are evolved during the adaptive process
in a PDE-independent manner, based on the discrepancies between global and local
orthogonal projections. (Sometimes we replace the global orthogonal projection with
the solve on the coarse mesh, the difference is negligible.)

The obvious disadvantage of this approach to adaptivity is its higher computational cost,
especially in 3D. We are aware of this fact and would not mind at all replacing it with
some cheaper technique (as long as it also is PDE-independent, works for elements of high 
orders, and can be successfully used to guide *hp*-adaptivity).

Understanding Convergence Rates
-------------------------------

Hermes provides convergence graphs for every adaptive computation. Therefore,
let us spend a short moment explaining their meaning.
The classical notion of $O(h^p)$ convergence rate is related to sequences of 
uniform meshes with a gradually decreasing diameter $h$. In $d$ spatial dimensions, 
the diameter $h$ of a uniform mesh is related to the number of degrees of freedom $N$
through the relation 

.. math::

    h = O(N^{-p/d}).

Therefore a slope of $-p/d$ on the log-log scale means that $err \approx O(N^{-p/d})$
or $err \approx O(h^p)$. When local refinements are enabled, the meaning of $O(h^p)$
convergence rate loses its meaning, and one should switch to convergence in terms of 
the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) or CPU time - Hermes provides both. 

Algebraic convergence of adaptive $h$-FEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using elements of degree $p$, the convergence rate of adaptive $h$-FEM will not exceed the 
one predicted for uniformly refined meshes (this can be explained using 
mathematical analysis). Nevertheless, the convergence may be faster due to a different 
constant in front of the $h^p$ term. This is illustrated in the following two figures,
both of which are related to a 2D problem with known exact solution. The first pair of 
graphs corresponds to adaptive $h$-FEM with linear elements. The slope on the log-log
graph is -1/2 which means first-order convergence, as predicted by theory. 

.. image:: img/conv-intro/layer_h1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 450
   :alt: Convergence graph.

The next pair of convergence graphs corresponds to adaptive $h$-FEM with quadratic elements. 
The slope on the log-log graph is -1, which means that the convergence is quadratic as 
predicted by theory.

.. image:: img/conv-intro/layer_h2.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 450
   :alt: Convergence graph.

Note that one always should look at the end of the convergence curve, not at the 
beginning. The automatic adaptivity in Hermes is guided with the so-called 
*reference solution*, which is an approximation on a globally-refined mesh.
In early stages of adaptivity, the reference solution and in turn also the error 
estimate usually are not sufficiently accurate to deliver the expected convergence 
rates. 

Exponential convergence of adaptive $hp$-FEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is predicted by theory that adaptive $hp$-FEM should attain 
exponential convergence rate. This means that the slope of the
convergence graph is steadily increasing, as shown in the 
following figure.

.. image:: img/conv-intro/aniso-hp.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 450
   :alt: Convergence graph.

While this often is the case with adaptive $hp$-FEM, there are 
problems whose difficulty is such that the convergence is not 
exponential. Or at least not during a long pre-asymptotic 
stage of adaptivity. This may happen, for example, when the solution 
contains an extremely strong singularity. Then basically all error 
is concentrated there, and all adaptive methods will do the same, 
which is to throw into the singularity as many small low-order 
elements as possible. Then the convergence of adaptive $h$-FEM 
and $hp$-FEM may be very similar (usually quite poor).


Estimated vs. exact convergence rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever exact solution is available, Hermes provides both 
estimated error (via the reference solution) as well as the 
exact error. Thus the user can see the quality of the 
error estimate. Note that the estimated error usually is 
slightly less than the exact one, but during adaptivity 
they quickly converge together and become virtually identical. 
This is shown in the figure below.

Electrostatic Micromotor Problem
--------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `10-adapt <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/10-adapt>`_. 

Let us demostrate the use of adaptive h-FEM and hp-FEM on a linear elliptic problem
concerned with the calculation of
the electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the electrodes of an electrostatic
micromotor. This is a MEMS device free of any coils, and thus resistive to
strong electromagnetic waves (as opposed to classical electromotors).
The following figure shows one half of the domain $\Omega$
(dimensions need to be scaled with $10^{-5}$ and are in meters):

.. image:: img/micromotor.png
   :align: center
   :width: 550
   :height: 400
   :alt: Computational domain for the micromotor problem.

The subdomain $\Omega_2$ represents the moving part of the domain and the area bounded by $\Gamma_2$
represents the electrodes that are fixed. The distribution of the electrostatic potential $\varphi$ is governed by the equation

.. math::

    -\nabla\cdot\left(\epsilon_r\nabla\varphi\right) = 0,

equipped with the Dirichlet boundary conditions

.. math::

    \varphi = 0 V \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{on}\ \Gamma_1,


.. math::

    \varphi = 50 V \ \ \ \ \mbox{on}\ \Gamma_2.

The relative permittivity $\epsilon_r$ is piecewise-constant, $\epsilon_r = 1$ in $\Omega_1$ and
$\epsilon_r = 10$ in $\Omega_2$. The weak formulation reads

.. math::

    \int_\Omega \epsilon_r \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \dx = 0.

The varying parameter $\epsilon_r$ is handled by defining two bilinear forms in the code, one for
$\Omega_1$ and the other for $\Omega_2$. These two areas are delimited by element markers 1 and 2 in
the mesh, and the two forms are assigned to the corresponding markers during the registration of
the forms:

::

    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(biform1), SYM, 1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(biform2), SYM, 2);

The principal part of the example is the main adaptivity loop. In each iteration, the coarse problem
is solved first:

::

    // solve the coarse problem
    LinSystem ls(&wf, &solver);
    ls.set_spaces(1, &space);
    ls.set_pss(1, &pss);
    ls.assemble();
    ls.solve(1, &sln_coarse);

Next, the reference solution is computed on a globally refined copy of the mesh,
defining a temporary space with increased element orders and by assembling and solving an extra
linear system. However, for most problems, this can be automated using the class RefSystem, which
handles all the temporary reference meshes and spaces transparently. All it needs is a pointer to our coarse
LinSystem. The calculation of the reference solution is as simple as the following:

::

    // solve the fine mesh problem
    RefSystem rs(&ls);
    rs.assemble();
    rs.solve(1, &sln_fine);

In the third and last step of each iteration, we refine our mesh and polynomial degrees stored
in our space using a class called H1OrthoHP. This class offers two services: it is able to
calculate  the estimate of the overall error of the coarse solution in $H^1$ norm, and if the
error is too large, you can ask the class to *hp*-adapt your mesh and element orders optimally.

H1OrthoHP is initialized with the number of spaces in the problem and pointers to them.
The method calc_error() takes pointers to the coarse and reference solutions and returns

.. math::

    e = \frac{|| u - u_{ref} ||_{H^1}}{|| u_{ref} ||_{H^1}}.

In the code this looks as follows:

::

    H1OrthoHP hp(1, &space);
    double err_est = hp.calc_error(&sln_coarse, &sln_fine) * 100;

Finally, if err_est is still above the threshold ERR_STOP, we perform one
adaptivity step:

::

    if (err_est < ERR_STOP) done = true;
    else {
      hp.adapt(THRESHOLD, STRATEGY, ADAPT_TYPE, ISO_ONLY, MESH_REGULARITY);
      ndofs = space.assign_dofs();
      if (ndofs >= NDOF_STOP) done = true;
    }

The function adapt() accepts additional optional input parameters for more 
advanced use - see the file 
`src/adapt_h1_ortho.h <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/adapt_ortho_h1.h>`_ 
for more details. 
The basic parameters THRESHOLD, STRATEGY, ADAPT_TYPE, ISO_ONLY and MESH_REGULARITY
have the following meaning: STRATEGY indicates which adaptive strategy we
want to use:

* STRATEGY == 0: Refine elements until sqrt(THRESHOLD) times total error is processed. If more elements have similar error refine all to keep the mesh symmetric.
* STRATEGY == 1: Refine all elements whose error is bigger than THRESHOLD times maximum element error.
* STRATEGY == 2: Refine all elements whose error is bigger than THRESHOLD.

If ADAPT_TYPE == 0, *hp*-adaptivity is performed (default). If ADAPT_TYPE == 1,
the algorithm does *h*-adaptivity (fixed polynomial degrees of elements). This option is there
for comparison purposes. With ADAPT_TYPE == 2 the algorithm does pure *p*-adaptivity (element
geometries fixed). This option is there for completeness, adaptive *p*-FEM is not very 
useful in practice.

The parameter ISO_ONLY determines whether quadrilateral elements
can be split anisotropically (into two elements). The parameter MESH_REGULARITY
specifies maximum allowed level of hanging nodes: -1 means arbitrary-level
hanging nodes (default), and 1, 2, 3, ... means 1-irregular mesh,
2-irregular mesh, etc. Hermes does not support adaptivity on regular meshes
because of its extremely poor performance.

It is a good idea to spend some time playing with these parameters to
get a feeling for adaptive *hp*-FEM. Also look at other adaptivity examples in
the examples/ directory: layer, lshape deal with elliptic problems and have
known exact solutions. So do examples screen, bessel for time-harmonic
Maxwell's equations. These examples allow you to compare the error estimates
computed by Hermes with the true error. Examples crack, singpert show
how to handle cracks and singularly perturbed problems, respectively. There
are also more advanced examples illustrating automatic adaptivity for nonlinear
problems solved via the Newton's method, adaptive multimesh *hp*-FEM,
adaptivity for time-dependent problems on dynamical meshes, etc.

But let's return to the micromotor example for a moment again: The computation
starts with a very coarse mesh consisting of a few quadrilaterals, some
of which are moreover very ill-shaped. Thanks to the anisotropic refinement
capabilities of H1OrthoHP, the mesh quickly adapts to the solution
and elements of reasonable shape are created near singularities, which occur
at the corners of the electrode. Initially, all elements of the mesh
are of a low degree, but as the *hp*-adaptive process progresses, the elements
receive different polynomial degrees, depending on the local smoothness of the
solution.

The gradient was visualized using VectorView. We have
seen this in the previous section. We plug in the same solution for both vector
components, but specify that its derivatives should be used:

::

    gview.show(&sln, &sln, EPS_NORMAL, FN_DX_0, FN_DY_0);

The Multimesh hp-FEM
--------------------

In multiphysics PDE systems (or just PDE systems) it can happen that one
physical field (solution component) has a singularity or a boundary layer 
where other fields are smooth. If one approximates all fields on the 
same mesh, then the necessity to refine the mesh at the singularity
or boundary layer implies new degrees of freedom for the smooth fields 
as well. This can be very wasteful indeed, as we will see in the next
example that deals with a simplified Fitzhugh-Nagumo system. But let us 
first explain briefly the main idea of the multimesh discretization 
method that we developed to circumvent this problem.

Hermes makes it possible to approximate them 
on individual meshes. These meshes are not completely independent
of each other -- they have a common coarse mesh that we call *master mesh*.
The master mesh is there for algorithmic purposes only, it may not 
even be used for discretization purposes: Every mesh in the system 
is obtained from it via an arbitrary sequence of elementary refinements.
This is illustrated in the following figure, where (A) is the master mesh,
(B) - (D) three different meshes (say, for a coupled problem with three
equations), and (E) is the virtual *union mesh* that is used for assembling.

.. image:: img/multimesh/multimesh.png
   :align: center
   :width: 750
   :alt: Multimesh

The union mesh is not constructed physically in the computer memory -- 
merely it serves as a hint to correctly transform integration points
while integrating over sub-elements of the elements of the existing meshes. 
The following figure shows the integration over an element $Q_k$ of the 
virtual union mesh, and what are the appropriate subelements of the 
existing elements where this integration is performed:

.. image:: img/multimesh/multimesh2.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :alt: Multimesh

As a result, the multimesh discretization of the PDE system is *monolithic*
in the sense that *no physics is lost* -- all integrals in the 
discrete weak formulations are evaluated exactly up to the error in the 
numerical quadrature. In particular, we do not perform operator splitting 
or commit errors while transferring solution data between different meshes.
The multimesh assembling in Hermes works with all meshes at the same time, 
there is no such thing as interpolating or projecting functions between 
different meshes. More details about this method can be found in the 
corresponding `research article <http://science.atmoshome.net/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6TYH-4X1J73B-V-8Y&_cdi=5619&_user=10&_pii=S0377042709005731&_orig=browse&_coverDate=08%2F18%2F2009&_sk=999999999&view=c&wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkWz&md5=6552d3390232dcffc9ca97e9bb626fb0&ie=/sdarticle.pdf>`_. 

Adaptivity in the Multimesh hp-FEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In principle, the adaptivity procedure for single PDE could be extended 
directly to systems of PDEs. In other words, two spaces can be passed into H1OrthoHP,
four solutions (two coarse, two reference) can be passed into calc_error_2(),
and finally, adapt can be called as before. In this way, error estimates in
$H^1$ norm are calculated for elements in both spaces independently and the
worst ones are refined. However, this approach is not optimal if the PDEs are
coupled, since an error caused in one solution component influences the errors
in other components and vice versa.

Recall that in elliptic problems the bilinear form $a(u,v)$ defines the energetic inner product,

.. math::

    (u,v)_e = a(u,v).

The norm induced by this product,

.. math::

    ||u||_e = \sqrt{(u,u)_e},

is called the *energy norm*. When measuring the error in the energy norm
of the entire system, one can reduce the above-mentioned difficulties dramatically.
When calculating the error on an element, the energy norm accounts
also for the error caused by other solution components. 

It is also worth mentioning that the adaptivity algorithm does not make distinctions 
between various meshes. The elements of *all meshes in the system* are put into one
single array, sorted according to their estimated errors, and then the ones with the 
largest error are refined. In other words, it may happen that all elements marked for refinement 
will belong just to one mesh.


Simplified Fitzhugh-Nagumo System
---------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `11-adapt-system <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/11-adapt-system>`_. 

We consider a simplified version of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation.
This equation is a~prominent example of activator-inhibitor systems in two-component reaction-diffusion 
equations, It describes a prototype of an excitable system (e.g., a neuron) and its stationary form 
is

.. math::

    -d^2_u \Delta u - f(u) + \sigma v = g_1,\\
    -d^2_v \Delta v - u + v = g_2.

Here the unknowns $u, v$ are the voltage and $v$-gate, respectively, 
The nonlinear function 

.. math::

    f(u) = \lambda u - u^3 - \kappa
 
describes how an action potential travels through a nerve. Obviously this system is nonlinear.
In order to make it simpler for this tutorial, we replace the function $f(u)$ with just $u$:

.. math::

    f(u) = u.

The original nonlinear version is the subject of a separate benchmark example. 

Our computational domain is the square $(-1,1)^2$ and we consider zero Dirichlet conditions 
for both $u$ and $v$. In order to enable fair convergence comparisons, we will use the following 
functions as the exact solution:

.. math::

    u(x,y) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}x\right) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}y\right),\\
    v(x,y) = \hat u(x) \hat u(y)

where

.. math::

    \hat u(x) = 1 - \frac{e^{kx} + e^{-kx}}{e^k + e^{-k}}

is the exact solution of the one-dimensional singularly perturbed 
problem 

.. math::

    -u'' + k^2 u - k^2 = 0

in $(-1,1)$, equipped with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The functions $u$ 
and $v$ defined above evidently satisfy the given boundary conditions, and 
they also satisfy the equation, since we inserted them into the PDE system 
and calculated the source functions $g_1$ and $g_2$ from there. These functions 
are not extremely pretty, but they are not too bad either:

::

    // functions g_1 and g_2
    double g_1(double x, double y) 
    {
      return (-cos(M_PI*x/2.)*cos(M_PI*y/2.) + SIGMA*(1. - (exp(K*x) + exp(-K*x))/(exp(K) + exp(-K))) 
             * (1. - (exp(K*y) + exp(-K*y))/(exp(K) + exp(-K))) + pow(M_PI,2.)*pow(D_u,2.)*cos(M_PI*x/2.)
             *cos(M_PI*y/2.)/2.);
    }

    double g_2(double x, double y) 
    {
      return ((1. - (exp(K*x) + exp(-K*x))/(exp(K) + exp(-K)))*(1. - (exp(K*y) + exp(-K*y))/(exp(K) + exp(-K))) 
             - pow(D_v,2.)*(-(1 - (exp(K*x) + exp(-K*x))/(exp(K) + exp(-K)))*(pow(K,2.)*exp(K*y) + pow(K,2.)*exp(-K*y))/(exp(K) + exp(-K)) 
             - (1. - (exp(K*y) + exp(-K*y))/(exp(K) + exp(-K)))*(pow(K,2.)*exp(K*x) + pow(K,2.)*exp(-K*x))/(exp(K) + exp(-K))) - 
             cos(M_PI*x/2.)*cos(M_PI*y/2.));

    }

The weak forms can be found in the 
file `forms.cpp <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/11-adapt-system/forms.cpp>`_ and 
they are registered as follows:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(2);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form_0_0));  
    wf.add_biform(0, 1, callback(bilinear_form_0_1));  
    wf.add_biform(1, 0, callback(bilinear_form_1_0));
    wf.add_biform(1, 1, callback(bilinear_form_1_1));
    wf.add_liform(0, linear_form_0, linear_form_0_ord);
    wf.add_liform(1, linear_form_1, linear_form_1_ord);

Beware that despite each of the forms is actually symmetric, one cannot use the SYM flag as in the 
elasticity equations, since it has a slightly different 
meaning (see example `08-system <http://hpfem.org/hermes2d/doc/src/tutorial.html#systems-of-equations>`_).

The exact error is for us the maximum of the relative errors of the two solution components:

::

    // calculate error wrt. exact solution
    ExactSolution uexact(&umesh, u_exact);
    ExactSolution vexact(&vmesh, v_exact);
    double u_error = h1_error(&u_sln_coarse, &uexact) * 100;
    double v_error = h1_error(&v_sln_coarse, &vexact) * 100;
    double error = fmax(u_error, v_error);
    info("Exact solution error for u (H1 norm): %g%%", u_error);
    info("Exact solution error for v (H1 norm): %g%%", v_error);
    info("Exact solution error (maximum): %g%%", error);

The next code snippet shows how we define the energy norm for adaptive
multimesh hp-FEM, whose necessity was explained in the previous 
paragraph:

::

    // calculate element error estimates and the total error estimate
    H1OrthoHP hp(2, &uspace, &vspace);
    hp.set_biform(0, 0, bilinear_form_0_0<scalar, scalar>, bilinear_form_0_0<Ord, Ord>);
    hp.set_biform(0, 1, bilinear_form_0_1<scalar, scalar>, bilinear_form_0_1<Ord, Ord>);
    hp.set_biform(1, 0, bilinear_form_1_0<scalar, scalar>, bilinear_form_1_0<Ord, Ord>);
    hp.set_biform(1, 1, bilinear_form_1_1<scalar, scalar>, bilinear_form_1_1<Ord, Ord>);
    double err_est = hp.calc_error_2(&u_sln_coarse, &v_sln_coarse, &u_sln_fine, &v_sln_fine) * 100;
    info("Estimate of error wrt. ref. solution (energy norm): %g%%", err_est);

The following two figures show the solutions $u$ and $v$. Notice their 
large qualitative differences: While $u$ is smooth in the entire domain, 
$v$ has a thin boundary layer along the boundary:

======================================
Tutorial Part III (Nonlinear Problems)
======================================

The next part of the tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with basic concepts 
covered in the first part. We will discuss the Newton's method for nonlinear PDE and 
PDE systems, for both stationary and time-dependent models. At the end of this chapter,
the reader will be able to solve time-dependent nonlinear problems adaptively using
dynamical meshes. 

The Newton's Method
-------------------

Hermes can solve nonlinear problems via the Newton's method, both single nonlinear
PDE and nonlinear PDE systems. We begin with explaining how the Newton's method works, and 
concrete implementation details will be shown after that. 
Consider a simple model problem of the form 

.. math::
    :label: newton0

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(\bfx) = 0, \ \ \ u = 0 \ \mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega.

Note that when using the Newton's method, it is customary to have 
everything on the left-hand side. The corresponding discrete problem has the form 

.. math::

    \int_{\Omega} \lambda(u)\nabla u(\bfx) \cdot \nabla v_i(\bfx)\, \mbox{d}\bfx 
    - \int_{\Omega} f(\bfx)v_i(\bfx) \, \mbox{d}\bfx\ \ \ \mbox{for all} \ i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, 

where $v_i$ are the standard test functions and

.. math::

    u(\bfY) = \sum_{j=1}^N y_j v_j.

Here $\bfY = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_N)^T$ is the vector of unknown coefficients.
The nonlinear discrete problem can be written in the compact form

.. math::

    \bfF(\bfY) = {\bf 0},
 
where $\bfF = (F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_N)^T$ is the residual vector defined by

.. math::

    F_i(\bfY) =  \int_{\Omega} \lambda(u)\nabla u \cdot \nabla v_i 
    - f v_i \, \mbox{d}\bfx.

The Jacobi matrix $\bfJ(\bfY) = D\bfF/D\bfY$ has the same sparsity structure as the 
standard stiffness matrix that we know from linear problems. In fact, when the 
problem is linear then the Jacobi matrix and the stiffness matrix are the same 
thing. Using the chain rule of differentiation, we calculate that on the 
position $ij$, the Jacobi matrix has the value

.. math::

    J_{ij}(\bfY) =  \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial y_j} = 
    \int_{\Omega} \left[ \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial u} \frac{\partial u}{\partial y_j} 
    \nabla u + \lambda(u)\frac{\partial \nabla u}{\partial y_j} \right] \cdot \nabla v_i \, \mbox{d}\bfx.

To this end, note that 

.. math::

    \frac{\partial u}{\partial y_k} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y_k}\sum_{j=1}^N y_j v_j = v_k

and 

.. math::

    \frac{\partial \nabla u}{\partial y_k} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y_k}\sum_{j=1}^N y_j \nabla v_j = \nabla v_k.


Using these relations, we obtain

.. math::

    J_{ij}(\bfY) =
    \int_{\Omega} \left[ \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial u}(u) v_j 
    \nabla u + \lambda(u)\nabla v_j \right] \cdot \nabla v_i \, \mbox{d}\bfx.

Let's assume that the Jacobi matrix has been assembled. 
The Newton's method is written formally as 

.. math::

    \bfY_{\!\!n+1} = \bfY_{\!\!n} - \bfJ^{-1}(\bfY_{\!\!n}) \bfF(\bfY_{\!\!n}),

but a more practical formula to work with is 

.. math::

    \bfJ(\bfY_{\!\!n})\delta \bfY_{\!\!n+1} =  - \bfF(\bfY_{\!\!n}).

This is a system of linear algebraic equations that needs to be solved in every Newton's 
iteration. The Newton's method will stop when $\bfF(\bfY_{\!\!n+1})$ is sufficiently close 
to the zero vector.

A remark on the linear case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the linear case we have 

.. math::

    \bfF(\bfY) = \bfJ(\bfY)\bfY - \bfb,

where $\bfS = \bfJ(\bfY)$ is a constant stiffness matrix and $\bfb$ a load vector. 
The Newton's method is now

.. math::

    \bfS\bfY_{\!\!n+1} = \bfJ(\bfY_{\!\!n})\bfY_{\!\!n} 
    - \bfJ(\bfY_{\!\!n})\bfY_{\!\!n} + \bfb = \bfb.

Therefore, the Newton's method will converge in one iteration.


Constant Initial Guess
----------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `13-newton-elliptic-1 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/13-newton-elliptic-1>`_.

We will solve the nonlinear model problem defined in the previous section,

.. math::

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0, \ \ \ u = 0 \ \mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega.

One possible interpretation of this equation is stationary heat transfer where the thermal
conductivity $\lambda$ depends on the temperature $u$.
Our domain is a square $\Omega = (-10,10)^2$, $f(x,y) = 1$, and the nonlinearity $\lambda$ has the form 

.. math::

    \lambda(u) = 1 + u^\alpha.

Recall that $\lambda$ must be entirely positive or entirely negative for the problem to be solvable, so it is safe 
to restrict $\alpha$ to be an even nonnegative integer. Recall from the previous section that 

.. math::

    F_i(\bfY) =  \int_{\Omega} \lambda(u)\nabla u \cdot \nabla v_i 
    - f v_i \, \mbox{d}x\mbox{d}y.

and

.. math::

    J_{ij}(\bfY) =
    \int_{\Omega} \left[ \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial u}(u) v_j 
    \nabla u + \lambda(u)\nabla v_j \right] \cdot \nabla v_i \, \mbox{d}x\mbox{d}y.

In the code, this becomes

::

    // Heat sources (can be a general function of 'x' and 'y')
    template<typename Real>
    Real heat_src(Real x, Real y)
    {
      return 1.0;
    }

    // Jacobian matrix
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar jac(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev = ext->fn[0];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * (dlam_du(u_prev->val[i]) * u->val[i] * (u_prev->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
                           + lam(u_prev->val[i]) * (u->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u->dy[i] * v->dy[i]));
                       
      return result;
    }

    // Fesidual vector
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar res(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev = ext->fn[0];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * (lam(u_prev->val[i]) * (u_prev->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
	    	           - heat_src(e->x[i], e->y[i]) * v->val[i]);
      return result;
    }

Notice that the basis function $v_j$ and the test function 
$v_i$ are entering the weak forms via the parameters u and v, respectively (same as for linear problems). 
The user does not have to 
take care about their indices $i$ and $j$, this is handled by Hermes outside the weak forms. 

The code snippet above also shows how values and derivatives of the solution $u$ can be accessed via 
the ExtData structure, and the coordinates of the integration points via the Geom structure. 
The contents of ExtData is user-defined and the Geom structure contains geometrical information 
including the unit normal and tangential vectors to the boundary at the integration points 
(also for curved boundaries). See the file 
`src/forms.h <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/forms.h>`_ for more details. 

The weak forms are registered as usual, except that the previous solution u_prev has to be declared in advance:

::

    // previous solution for the Newton's iteration
    Solution u_prev;

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(jac), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &u_prev);
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(res), ANY, 1, &u_prev);

The nonlinear system needs to be initialized:

::

    // initialize the nonlinear system and solver
    UmfpackSolver umfpack;
    NonlinSystem nls(&wf, &umfpack);
    nls.set_spaces(1, &space);
    nls.set_pss(1, &pss);

In this example, we set the initial guess for the Newton's iteration to be 
a constant function:

::

    // use a constant function as the initial guess
    u_prev.set_const(&mesh, 3.0);
    nls.set_ic(&u_prev, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

The function set_ic() takes an initial guess (the first argument),
projects it on the finite element mesh, and stores the result in the 
second argument. 
The projection norm PROJ_TYPE needs to be compatible with the Sobolev
space where the solution is sought ($H^1$ in this example). 
Hermes currently provides $H^1$-projection (PROJ_TYPE = 1) and 
$L^2$-projection (PROJ_TYPE = 0). Other projections (H(curl), H(div) etc.)
will be added later when a need arises. 

A more advanced example showing how to define a general initial guess 
and how to deal with nonzero Dirichlet boundary conditions will follow. 
The Newton's loop is very simple,

::

    // Newton's loop
    nls.solve_newton_1(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

Note that up to three Filters can be passed to the function 
as optional parameters at the end. This function can be found in 
`src/nonlinsystem.h <http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/nonlinsystem.h>`_.

General Initial Guess
---------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `14-newton-elliptic-2 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/14-newton-elliptic-2>`_.

We will solve the nonlinear model problem from the previous section again,

.. math::

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0 \ \ \ \mbox{in } \Omega = (-10,10)^2

but now with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions 

.. math::

    u(x, y) = (x+10)(y+10)/100 \ \ \ \mbox{on } \partial \Omega

and with a general initial guess init_guess(x,y).

The treatment of the Dirichlet boundary conditions in the code looks as follows:

::

    // This function is used to define Dirichlet boundary conditions
    double dir_lift(double x, double y, double& dx, double& dy) {
      dx = (y+10)/10.;
      dy = (x+10)/10.;
      return (x+10)*(y+10)/100.;
    }

    // Boundary condition type (essential = Dirichlet)
    int bc_types(int marker)
    {
      return BC_ESSENTIAL;
    }

    // Dirichlet boundary condition values
    scalar bc_values(int marker, double x, double y)
    {
      double dx, dy;
      return dir_lift(x, y, dx, dy); 
    }

The initial guess for the Newton's method will be chosen to be the 
Dirichlet lift function elevated by 2:

::

    // This function will be projected on the initial mesh and 
    // used as initial guess for the Newton's method
    scalar init_guess(double x, double y, double& dx, double& dy)
    {
      // using the Dirichlet lift elevated by two
      double val = dir_lift(x, y, dx, dy) + 2;
    }

The initial guess is projected to the initial mesh using the set_ic()
method of the Nonlinsystem class:

::

    // project the function init_guess() on the mesh 
    // to obtain initial guess u_prev for the Newton's method
    nls.set_ic(init_guess, &mesh, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

This function creates an orthogonal projection of the initial guess
on the mesh "mesh" and stores the result in u_prev. 
The following figure shows the  
$H^1$-projection of the above-defined initial guess init_guess():

.. image:: img/example-14/proj-h1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 350
   :alt: H1 projection

The Newton's iteration is performed again using

::

    // Newton's loop
    nls.solve_newton_1(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);


The converged solution after 7 steps of the Newton's
method looks as follows:

Newton's Method and Adaptivity
------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `15-newton-elliptic-adapt 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/15-newton-elliptic-adapt>`_.

We will keep the simple model problem

.. math::

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0 \ \ \ \mbox{in } \Omega = (-10,10)^2,

equipped with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions 

.. math::

    u(x, y) = (x+10)(y+10)/100 \ \ \ \mbox{on } \partial \Omega,

but this time it will be solved using automatic adaptivity. As usual in Hermes, adaptivity
will be guided by the difference between a coarse and fine mesh approximations. At the beginning,
the initial condition is projected on the coarse mesh:

::

    // project the function init_guess() on the coarse mesh 
    // to obtain initial guess u_prev for the Newton's method
    nls.set_ic(init_guess, &mesh, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

Then we solve the nonlinear problem on the coarse mesh and store
the coarse mesh solution:

::

    // Newton's loop on the coarse mesh
    info("---- Solving on coarse mesh:\n");
    if (!nls.solve_newton_1(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL_COARSE, NEWTON_MAX_ITER)) error("Newton's method did not converge.");

    // store the result in sln_coarse
    sln_coarse.copy(&u_prev);

Next the nonlinear problem on the fine mesh is initialized as follows:

::

    // Setting initial guess for the Newton's method on the fine mesh
    RefNonlinSystem rnls(&nls);
    rnls.prepare();
    if (a_step == 1) rnls.set_ic(&sln_coarse, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);
    else rnls.set_ic(&sln_fine, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);    

Notice that we only use sln_coarse as the initial guess on the fine mesh 
in the first adaptivity step when we do not have any fine mesh solution yet,
otherwise a projection of the last fine mesh solution is used. Then we perform the 
Newton's loop on the fine mesh and store the result in sln_fine:

::

    // Newton's loop on the fine mesh
    if (!rnls.solve_newton_1(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL_FINE, NEWTON_MAX_ITER)) error("Newton's method did not converge.");

    // stote the fine mesh solution in sln_fine
    sln_fine.copy(&u_prev);

Now we have the desired solution pair, and the error estimate is calculated as usual:

::

    // calculate element errors and total error estimate
    H1OrthoHP hp(1, &space);
    err_est = hp.calc_error(&sln_coarse, &sln_fine) * 100;
    if (verbose) info("Error estimate: %g%%", err_est);

After adapting the mesh, we must not forget to update the coarse mesh solution. 
This can be done either by just projecting the fine mesh solution onto 
the new coarse mesh, or by solving in addition to that the nonlinear
problem on the new coarse mesh:

::

    // if err_est too large, adapt the mesh
    if (err_est < ERR_STOP) done = true;
    else {
      hp.adapt(THRESHOLD, STRATEGY, ADAPT_TYPE, ISO_ONLY, MESH_REGULARITY);
      int ndof = space.assign_dofs();
      if (ndof >= NDOF_STOP) done = true;

      // project the fine mesh solution on the new coarse mesh
      info("---- Projecting fine mesh solution on new coarse mesh:\n");
      nls.set_ic(&sln_fine, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

      if (NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH) {
        // Newton's loop on the coarse mesh
        info("---- Solving on coarse mesh:\n");
        if (!nls.solve_newton_1(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL_COARSE, NEWTON_MAX_ITER)) error("Newton's method did not converge.");
      }

      // store the result in sln_coarse
      sln_coarse.copy(&u_prev);
    }

The parameter NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH is provided to allow the user to do his 
own experiments, but the default value is NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH = false.
In our experience, the Newton's loop on the coarse mesh can be skipped
in most cases since it does not affect the convergence and one saves some
CPU time. This is illustrated in the following two convergence comparisons:

Convergence in the number of DOF (with and without Newton solve on coarse mesh):

In the following we show the resulting meshes (corresponding to 
NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH = false). The solution itself is not 
shown since the reader knows it from the previous example.

Nonlinear Parabolic Problem
---------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `16-newton-timedep-heat 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/16-newton-timedep-heat>`_.

We will employ the Newton's method to solve a nonlinear parabolic PDE discretized 
in time by means of the implicit Euler method. To keep things simple, our model problem is 
a time-dependent version of the nonlinear equation used in the previous three sections,

.. math::

    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0.

Again we prescribe nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions 

.. math::

    u(x, y) = (x+10)(y+10)/100 \ \ \ \mbox{on } \partial \Omega,

and the same function is used to define the initial condition. The 
problem will be solved in the square $\Omega = (-10,10)^2$ and time interval $(0, T)$.

The weak formulation of the time-discretized problem reads

.. math::

    \int_{\Omega} \frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\tau}v + \lambda(u^{n+1})\nabla u^{n+1}\cdot \nabla v - fv\, \mbox{d}x\mbox{d}y = 0,

where the indices $n$ and $n+1$ indicate the previous and new time level, respectively. Hence in each 
time step we need to solve a *time-independent* nonlinear problem, and this is something we learned 
in the previous sections. The weak forms for the Newton's method from the previous sections only 
need to be enhanced with a simple term containing the time step $\tau$ (called TAU):

::

    // Jacobian matrix
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar jac(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev_newton = ext->fn[0];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * (u->val[i] * v->val[i] / TAU + dlam_du(u_prev_newton->val[i]) * u->val[i] * 
                           (u_prev_newton->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev_newton->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
                           + lam(u_prev_newton->val[i]) * (u->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u->dy[i] * v->dy[i]));                    
      return result;
    }

Here the function u_prev_newton plays the role of u_prev from the previous sections - this is the 
previous solution inside the Newton's iteration. Note that the previous time level solution 
$u^n$ that we call u_prev_time is not used in the Jacobian. It is used in the residual only:

::

    // Fesidual vector
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar res(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev_newton = ext->fn[0];
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev_time = ext->fn[1];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * ((u_prev_newton->val[i] - u_prev_time->val[i]) * v->val[i] / TAU +
                          lam(u_prev_newton->val[i]) * (u_prev_newton->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev_newton->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
		           - heat_src(e->x[i], e->y[i]) * v->val[i]);
      return result;
    }

Notice that the function u_prev_newton evolves during the Newton's iteration
but the previous time level solution u_prev_time only is updated after the time step
is finished. The weak forms and the previous solutions are registered as usual:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(jac), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &u_prev_newton);
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(res), ANY, 2, &u_prev_newton, &u_prev_time);

The entire time-stepping loop looks as follows:

::

    // time stepping loop
    double current_time = 0.0;
    int t_step = 1;
    do {
      info("\n**** Time step %d, t = %g s:\n", t_step++, current_time);

      // Newton's method
      nls.solve_newton_1(&u_prev_newton, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

      // update previous time level solution
      u_prev_time.copy(&u_prev_newton);

      // update time
      current_time += TAU;

    } while (current_time < T_FINAL);

The stationary solution is not shown since we already saw it in the previous sections.


Flame Propagation Problem
-------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `17-newton-timedep-flame 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/17-newton-timedep-flame>`_.

We will employ the Newton's method to solve a nonlinear system of two parabolic equations 
describing a very simple flame propagation model (laminar flame, no fluid mechanics involved).
The computational domain shown below contains in the middle a narrow portion (cooling rods) 
whose purpose is to slow down the chemical reaction:

.. image:: img/example-17/domain.png
   :align: center
   :width: 760
   :alt: computational domain

The equations for the temperature $T$ and species concentration $Y$ have the form

.. math::

    \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \Delta T = \omega(T, Y),\\
    \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{Le}\Delta Y = -\omega(T, Y).

Boundary conditions are Dirichlet $T = 1$ and $Y = 0$ on the inlet, 
Newton $\partial T/\partial n = - \kappa T$ on the cooling rods, 
and Neumann $\partial T/\partial n = 0$, $\partial Y/\partial n = 0$ elsewhere.
The objective of the computation is to obtain the *reaction rate* defined
by the Arrhenius law,

.. math::

    \omega(T, Y) = \frac{\beta^2}{2{\rm Le}} Y e^{\frac{\beta(T - 1)}{1 + \alpha(T-1)}}.

Here $\alpha$ is the gas expansion coefficient in a flow with nonconstant density,
$\beta$ the non-dimensional activation energy, and  
$\rm Le$ the Lewis number (ratio of diffusivity of heat and diffusivity 
of mass). Both $\theta$, $0 \le \theta \le 1$ and 
$Y$, $0 \le Y \le 1$ are dimensionless and so is the time $t$. 

Time integration is performed using a second-order implicit BDF formula

.. math::

    T^{n+1} = -\frac{1}{2} T_1^{n+1} + \frac{3}{2} T_2^{n+1},\\
    Y^{n+1} = -\frac{1}{2} Y_1^{n+1} + \frac{3}{2} Y_2^{n+1},

that is obtained using a combination of the following two first-order methods:

.. math::

    \frac{T_1^{n+1} - T^{n}}{\tau} = \Delta T_1^{n+1} + \omega(T_1^{n+1}, Y_1^{n+1}),\\
    \frac{Y_1^{n+1} - Y^{n}}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\rm Le} \ \Delta Y_1^{n+1} - \omega(\theta_1^{n+1}, Y_1^{n+1}),

and 

.. math::

    \frac{T_2^{n+1} - T^{n}}{\tau} = \frac{2}{3}\left(\Delta T_2^{n+1} + \omega(T_2^{n+1}, Y_2^{n+1})\right) +                                            \frac{1}{3}\left(\Delta T_2^{n} + \omega(T_2^{n}, Y_2^{n})\right),\\
    \frac{Y_2^{n+1} - Y^{n}}{\tau} = \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\rm Le}\ \Delta Y_2^{n+1} - \omega(T_2^{n+1}, Y_2^{n+1})\right) +
                                        \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\rm Le}\ \Delta Y_2^{n} - \omega(T_2^{n}, Y_2^{n})\right).
   
Problem parameters are chosen as

::

    // Problem constants
    const double Le    = 1.0;
    const double alpha = 0.8;
    const double beta  = 10.0;
    const double kappa = 0.1;
    const double x1 = 9.0;

It is worth mentioning that the initial conditions for $T$ and $Y$,

::

    // Initial conditions
    scalar temp_ic(double x, double y, scalar& dx, scalar& dy)
      { return (x <= x1) ? 1.0 : exp(x1 - x); }

    scalar conc_ic(double x, double y, scalar& dx, scalar& dy)
      { return (x <= x1) ? 0.0 : 1.0 - exp(Le*(x1 - x)); }

are defined as exact functions

::

    // setting initial conditions
    t_prev_time_1.set_exact(&mesh, temp_ic); y_prev_time_1.set_exact(&mesh, conc_ic);
    t_prev_time_2.set_exact(&mesh, temp_ic); y_prev_time_2.set_exact(&mesh, conc_ic);
    t_prev_newton.set_exact(&mesh, temp_ic);  y_prev_newton.set_exact(&mesh, conc_ic);

Here the pairs of solutions (t_prev_time_1, y_prev_time_1) and (t_prev_time_2, y_prev_time_2)
correspond to the two first-order time-stepping methods described above. and 
(t_prev_newton, y_prev_newton) are used to store the previous step approximation
in the Newton's method. The reaction rate $\omega$ and its derivatives are handled
via filters,

::

    // defining filters for the reaction rate omega
    DXDYFilter omega(omega_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);
    DXDYFilter omega_dt(omega_dt_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);
    DXDYFilter omega_dy(omega_dy_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);

Details on the functions omega_fn, omega_dt_fn, omega_dy_fn and the weak 
forms can be found in the file `forms.cpp 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/17-newton-timedep-flame/forms.cpp>`_
Here is how we register the weak forms,

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(2);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(newton_bilinear_form_0_0), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &omega_dt);
    wf.add_biform_surf(0, 0, callback(newton_bilinear_form_0_0_surf), 3);
    wf.add_biform(0, 1, callback(newton_bilinear_form_0_1), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &omega_dy);
    wf.add_biform(1, 0, callback(newton_bilinear_form_1_0), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &omega_dt);
    wf.add_biform(1, 1, callback(newton_bilinear_form_1_1), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &omega_dy);
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(newton_linear_form_0), ANY, 4, &t_prev_newton, &t_prev_time_1, &t_prev_time_2, &omega);
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(newton_linear_form_0_surf), 3, 1, &t_prev_newton);
    wf.add_liform(1, callback(newton_linear_form_1), ANY, 4, &y_prev_newton, &y_prev_time_1, &y_prev_time_2, &omega);

and how we initialize the nonlinear system and solver:

::

  // initialize the nonlinear system and solver
  UmfpackSolver umfpack;
  NonlinSystem nls(&wf, &umfpack);
  nls.set_spaces(2, &tspace, &cspace);
  nls.set_pss(1, &pss);
  nls.set_ic(&t_prev_time_1, &y_prev_time_1, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton, PROJ_TYPE);

The time stepping loop looks as follows, notice the visualization of $\omega$
through a DXDYFilter:

::

    // time stepping loop
    double current_time = 0.0;
    int t_step = 0;
    do {
      info("\n**** Time step %d, t = %g s:\n", ++t_step, current_time);

      // Newton's method
      nls.solve_newton_2(&t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER, 
                         &omega, &omega_dt, &omega_dy);

      // visualization
      DXDYFilter omega_view(omega_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);
      rview.set_min_max_range(0.0,2.0);
      char title[100];
      sprintf(title, "Reaction rate, t = %g", current_time);
      rview.set_title(title);
      rview.show(&omega_view);

      // update current time
      current_time += TAU;

      // store two previous time solutions
      t_prev_time_2.copy(&t_prev_time_1);
      y_prev_time_2.copy(&y_prev_time_1);
      t_prev_time_1.copy(&t_prev_newton);
      y_prev_time_1.copy(&y_prev_newton);
    } while (current_time <= T_FINAL);

Navier-Stokes Equations
-----------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `18-newton-timedep-ns 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/18-newton-timedep-ns>`_.

In this example, the time-dependent laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are
discretized in time via the implicit Euler method. If NEWTON == true,
the Newton's method is used to solve the nonlinear problem at each time 
step. If NEWTON == false, the convective term only is linearized using the 
velocities from the previous time step. Obviously the latter approach is wrong, 
but people do this frequently because it is faster and simpler to implement. 
Therefore we include this case for comparison purposes. We also show how 
to use discontinuous ($L^2$) elements for pressure and thus make the 
velocity discreetely divergence free. Comparison to approximating the 
pressure with the standard (continuous) Taylor-Hood elements is shown.  

The computational domain is a rectangular channel containing a 
circular obstacle: 

.. image:: img/example-18/domain.png
   :align: center
   :width: 760
   :alt: computational domain

The circle is defined via NURBS. Its radius and position, as well as some additional 
geometry parameters can be changed in the mesh file "domain.mesh":

::

    L = 15            # domain length (should be a multiple of 3)
    H = 5             # domain height
    S1 = 5/2          # x-center of circle
    S2 = 5/2          # y-center of circle
    R = 1             # circle radius
    A = 1/(2*sqrt(2)) # helper length
    EPS = 0.10        # vertical shift of the circle

The Navier-Stokes equations are assumed in the standard form

.. math::

    \frac{\partial \bfv}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{Re}\Delta \bfv + (\bfv \cdot \nabla) \bfv + \nabla p = 0,\\
    \mbox{div} \bfv = 0,

where $\bfv = (u, v)$ is the velocity vector, $Re$ the Reynolds number, $p$ the pressure,
and $(\bfv \cdot \nabla) \bfv$ the nonlinear convective term. We prescribe a parabolic 
velocity profile at inlet (the left-most edge). The inlet velocity is time-dependent, it 
increases linearly in time from zero to a user-defined value during an initial time period, 
and then it stays constant. Standard no-slip velocity boundary conditions are prescribed 
on the rest of the boundary with the exception of the outlet (right-most edge) where the 
standard "do nothing" boundary conditions are prescribed. No boundary conditions are 
prescribed for pressure - being an $L^2$-function, the pressure does not 
admit any boundary conditions. 

The role of the pressure in the Navier-Stokes equations 
is interesting and worth a brief discussion. Since the equations only contain its gradient, 
it is determined up to a constant. This does not mean that the problem is ill-conditioned 
though, since the pressure only plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier that keeps 
the velocity divergence-free. More precisely, the better the pressure is resolved, 
the closer the approximate velocity to being divergence free. The best one can do
is to approximate the pressure in $L^2$ (using discontinuous elements). Not only because
it is more meaningful from the point of view of the weak formulation, but also because
the approximate velocity automatically becomes discreetely divergence-free (integral 
of its divergence over every element in the mesh is zero). The standard Taylor-Hood 
elements approximating both the velocity and pressure with $H^1$-conforming (continuous)
elements do not have this property and thus are less accurate. We will compare these
two approaches below. Last, the pressure needs to be approximated by elements of 
a lower polynomial degree than the velocity in order to satisfy the inf-sup condition.

The time derivative is approximated using the implicit Euler method:

.. math::

    \frac{\bfv^{n+1}}{\tau} - \frac{\bfv^n}{\tau} - \frac{1}{Re}\Delta \bfv^{n+1} + (\bfv^{n+1} \cdot \nabla) \bfv^{n+1} + \nabla p^{n+1} = 0,\\
    \mbox{div} \bfv^{n+1} = 0,

where $\tau$ is the time step. This is a nonlinear problem that involves three equations (two for velocity components and 
the continuity equation). Accordingly, we define three spaces:

::

      // spaces for velocities and pressure
      H1Space xvel_space(&mesh, &h1_shapeset);
      H1Space yvel_space(&mesh, &h1_shapeset);
    #ifdef PRESSURE_IN_L2
      L2Space p_space(&mesh, &l2_shapeset);
    #else
      H1Space p_space(&mesh, &h1_shapeset);
    #endif

Next we define a nonlinear or linear problem to be solved in each time step,
depending on whether we want to employ the Newton's method or not:

::

      if (NEWTON) {
        // set up the nonlinear system
        nls.set_spaces(3, &xvel_space, &yvel_space, &p_space);
    #ifdef PRESSURE_IN_L2
        nls.set_pss(3, &h1_pss, &h1_pss, &l2_pss);
    #else
        nls.set_pss(1, &h1_pss);
    #endif
      }
      else {
        // set up the linear system
        ls.set_spaces(3, &xvel_space, &yvel_space, &p_space);
    #ifdef PRESSURE_IN_L2
        ls.set_pss(3, &h1_pss, &h1_pss, &l2_pss);
    #else
        ls.set_pss(1, &h1_pss);
    #endif
      }

The time stepping loop looks as follows:

::

    // time-stepping loop
    char title[100];
    int num_time_steps = T_FINAL / TAU;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num_time_steps; i++)
    {
      TIME += TAU;

      info("\n---- Time step %d, time = %g:\n", i, TIME);

      // this is needed to update the time-dependent boundary conditions
      ndofs = 0;
      ndofs += xvel_space.assign_dofs(ndofs);
      ndofs += yvel_space.assign_dofs(ndofs);
      ndofs += p_space.assign_dofs(ndofs);

      if (NEWTON) {
        // Newton's method
        nls.solve_newton_3(&xvel_prev_newton, &yvel_prev_newton, &p_prev, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

        // copy the result of the Newton's iteration into the 
        // previous time level solutions
        xvel_prev_time.copy(&xvel_prev_newton);
        yvel_prev_time.copy(&yvel_prev_newton);
      }
      else {
        // assemble and solve
        Solution xvel_sln, yvel_sln, p_sln;
        ls.assemble();
        ls.solve(3, &xvel_sln, &yvel_sln, &p_sln);

        // this copy destroys xvel_sln and yvel_sln 
        // which are no longer needed
        xvel_prev_time = xvel_sln;
        yvel_prev_time = yvel_sln;
      }
    }

The following comparisons demonstrate the effect of using the Newton's method, and continuous vs. discontinuous 
elements for the pressure. There are three triplets of velocity snapshots. In each one, the images 
were obtained with (1) NEWTON == false && PRESSURE_IN_L2 undefined, (2) NEWTON == true && PRESSURE_IN_L2 
undefined, and (3) NEWTON == true && PRESSURE_IN_L2 defined. It follows from these comparisons that one 
should definitely use the option (3).

Gross-Pitaevski Equation
------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `19-newton-timedep-gp 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/19-newton-timedep-gp>`_.

In this example we use the Newton's method to solve the nonlinear complex-valued 
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevski equation. This equation describes the ground state of 
a quantum system of identical bosons using the Hartree–Fock approximation and the 
pseudopotential interaction model. For time-discretization one can use either
the first-order implicit Euler method or the second-order Crank-Nicolson
method. 

The computational domain is the square $(-1,1)^2$ and boundary conditions are zero Dirichlet. The equation has the form 

.. math::

    i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \Delta \psi + g \psi |\psi|^2 + \frac{m}{2} \omega^2 (x^2 + y^2) \psi

where $\psi(x,y)$ is the unknown solution (wave function), $i$ the complex unit, 
$\hbar$ the Planck constant, $m$ the mass of the boson, 
$g$ the coupling constant (proportional to the scattering length of two interacting bosons) and 
$\omega$ the frequency.

From the implementation point of view, the only detail worth mentioning is the 
use of the complex version of Hermes in the `CMakeLists.txt 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/19-newton-timedep-gp/CMakeLists.txt>`_ file:

The way the weak forms are registered is standard:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    if(TIME_DISCR == 1) {
      wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(jacobian_euler), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &Psi_prev_newton);
      wf.add_liform(0, callback(residuum_euler), ANY, 2, &Psi_prev_newton, &Psi_prev_time);
    }
    else {
      wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(jacobian_cranic), UNSYM, ANY, 1, &Psi_prev_newton);
      wf.add_liform(0, callback(residuum_cranic), ANY, 2, &Psi_prev_newton, &Psi_prev_time);
    }

Also the time stepping loop and the call to the Newton's method 
will not surprize a reader who made it this far in the tutorial:

::

    // time stepping loop
    int nstep = (int)(T_FINAL/TAU + 0.5);
    for(int n = 1; n <= nstep; n++)
    {
      info("\n---- Time step %d:\n", n);

      // Newton's method
      nls.solve_newton_1(&Psi_prev_newton, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

      // copy result of the Newton's iteration into Psi_prev_time
      Psi_prev_time.copy(&Psi_prev_newton);
    }

Tutorial Part IV (Adaptivity for Time-Dependent Problems)
=========================================================

(Space-time) adaptive FEM and *hp*-FEM for time-dependent PDE and PDE systems is one of 
the most advanced techniques Hermes can do. Although we have published it 
in several `scientific articles 
<http://hpfem.math.unr.edu/people/pavel/public/papers.html>`_, 
there is still a lot of space for improvement. Let us know through the
`Hermes2D mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/hermes2d/>`_ if 
you are interested in getting involved. In this part of the tutorial 
we explain the basic idea of the method and show several examples.

Adaptive hp-FEM with Dynamical Meshes
-------------------------------------

The adaptivity with dynamical meshes in Hermes is based on the combination 
of the multimesh *hp*-FEM with the classical Rothe's method. 

The Rothe's method is a natural counterpart of the widely used Method of Lines (MOL). 
Recall that the MOL performs discretization in space while 
keeping the time variable continuous, which leads to a system of ODEs in time. The Rothe's 
method, on the contrary, preserves the continuity of the spatial variable while discretizing time. 
In every time step, an evolutionary PDE is approximated by means of one or more time-independent ones. 
The number of the time-independent equations per time step is proportional to the order of accuracy of the 
time discretization method. For example, when employing the implicit Euler method, one 
has to solve one time-independent PDE per time step. The Rothe's method is fully equivalent to the 
MOL if no adaptivity in space or time takes place, but it provides a better setting 
for the application of spatially adaptive algorithms. The spatial discretization error
can be controlled by solving the time-independent equations adaptively, and the size of 
the time step can be adjusted using standard ODE techniques. 

For the sake of clarity, let us consider a simple linear parabolic problem 

.. math::

    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \Delta u = f

and discretize the time variable using the implicit Euler method. We obtain 

.. math::

    \frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\tau} - \Delta u^{n+1} = f^{n+1},

where 

.. math::

    u^{n+1}(x,y) \approx u(x, y, t^{n+1})\ \mbox{and} \  f^{n+1}(x, y) \approx f(x, y, t^{n+1}).

The equation for $u^{n+1}$ does no longer depend on time and we can solve it adaptively 
as any other time-independent equation (or equation system). The only thing worth 
mentioning is that the previous time step approximation $u^n$ is now defined on 
a locally refined mesh that was obtained during the previous time step. This 
situation, however, can be handled routinely via the multimesh discretization 
method. In fact, the user does not have to worry about anything. The methodology is 
illustrated below.
