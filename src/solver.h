/// \brief Abstract interface to sparse linear solvers.
///
///  Solver is an abstract class defining the interface to all linear solvers
///  used by Hermes2D. A concrete derived class (UmfpackSolver, PardisoSolver...)
///  is instantiated by the user and passed to the LinSystem class to solve the
///  discrete problem. The user never directly calls any of the methods of this
///  class.
///
///  The linear solver can be direct or iterative, although the analyze() and
///  factorize() methods are clearly designed for direct solvers. These
///  methods are optional and do not have to be implemented by iterative solvers.
///
///  Another feature geared towards direct solvers is the possibility to store
///  auxiliary data (usually factorization data) between the calls to analyze(),
///  factorize() and solve() in an arbitrary data structure called "context".
///  This way the factorization can be reused to solve for different right hand
///  sides and/or different, but structurally identical matrices.
///
